LANCOM Systems End User License Agreement
for Software and Documentation

for "LANconfig", "LANmonitor", "WLANmonitor", "LANCOM Wireless ePaper Server", "LANCAPI", 
"LANCAPI Dial-up Networking support" and "CAPI Faxmodem", including the associated program 
descriptions, hereinafter referred to as "Software".

-------------------------------------------------------------
By installing, loading or using the Software, you are consenting to be bound by this agreement. If you 
do not agree to all of the terms of this agreement, do not download or install this Software.
-------------------------------------------------------------


The terms of the license for use of the LANCOM Systems (referred to hereinafter as 'LANCOM') 
software by the end user (referred to hereinafter as 'the Licensee'), are set out below.
Any use which is not in accordance with the licensing conditions below is not permitted. Insofar as the 
software contains open source components, the respective Open Source Terms of Service, in 
particular copyright notices and disclosure requirements, shall be observed. These can be found at the 
end of this license agreement.

Terms of agreement

1. Subject of the Agreement

The subject of the Agreement is the LANCOM software, supplied in file form and containing any or all 
parts of LANconfig, LANmonitor, WLANmonitor and LANCOM Wireless ePaper Server, and further 
affiliated software components, as well as drivers and configuration tools for LANCAPI, LANCAPI 
Remote Access Support and CAPI faxmodem support, including the associated software 
documentation.

Hereinafter these parts are subsumed and referred to as 'the software'.

LANCOM points out that in accordance with the present state of the art it is impossible to produce 
software which works perfectly with all systems and under all conditions. Therefore this Agreement 
covers a software which is in principle usable as described in the software documentation and user 
manual only.


2. Scope of Use

For the duration of this Agreement, LANCOM grants the Licensee a simple, non-exclusive, personal 
right (also referred to hereinafter as 'the License') to use the present copy of LANCOM software in 
combination with LANCOM products.
When operated in combination with LANCOM products, the software may also be installed on a 
number of different computers.


3. Exclusions

The Licensee may not:
a) Without LANCOM's prior written consent pass the software or the associated documents to any 
third party or otherwise make it available to third parties.
b) Alter, translate, decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble the software without LANCOM's prior 
written consent.
c) Produce programs derived from the software or reproduce the written documentation.
d) Translate the software or alter it or produce programs derived from the written documentation.

The translation, adaptation and any other form of modification or revision of the licensed software, 
including the creation of works derived from it, shall be exclusively reserved to LANCOM. However, 
this shall not affect the right of the Licensee to have errors corrected if and in so far as such a 
correction is necessary in order to use the products as intended. In this context LANCOM expressly 
advises the Licensee that even minor alterations to the products may cause significant, unpredictable 
errors in the use of the products and, as the case may be, the system environment. Consequently, the 
Licensee is expressly advised to refrain from modifying the licensed software without being authorized 
to do so; LANCOM is not responsible for risks arising therefrom.


4. Title to Rights

By acquiring this product, the Licensee merely acquire a non-exclusive license to use the software; 
this does not confer any rights to the software itself. In particular, LANCOM reserves all rights of 
publication, reproduction, processing and exploitation with respect of the software.


5) Copyright

LANCOM software is protected by copyright according to the provisions on the protection of computer 
programs. LANCOM's copyright covers in particular the program code, documentation, appearance, 
structure and setup of the program files, the program names, logos and other forms of presentation 
within the software.
Copyright notices, license and customer numbers, as well as other features serving to identify the 
program may not be removed or modified.
Parties wishing to provide LANCOM software on their own servers shall first file a respective request 
with info@lancom.de. The provision of LANCOM software on servers that do not belong to LANCOM 
is permitted only if this is confirmed by LANCOM thereupon.


6) Duration of Agreement

This Agreement applies for an unlimited period. The right of use granted herein shall automatically be 
terminated without notice if the Licensee ceases to use the LANCOM product, violates terms of this 
agreement, the underlying contractual relationship is invalid and/or is terminated or the agreement is 
reversed. 


7. Compensation in the Event of Breach of Contract

LANCOM points out that the Licensee is liable for any losses by reason of any breach of contract 
which LANCOM incurs as a result of the Licensee breaching any of the terms of the Agreement.


8. Amendments and Updates

LANCOM is entitled to create updates or new versions of the software  as it sees fit (in particular in 
regard to the frequency of release). These licensing conditions shall apply accordingly to any updates 
of the software.


9) Liability for defects in title / Intellectual property rights of third parties

The products and any updates provided are deemed to be free of any defects in title if their use as 
stipulated in this agreement is not in conflict with any rights of third parties.

Should a third party assert claims based upon a defect in title or if there is a risk that a third party could 
assert such claims, LANCOM shall at their discretion either
(a) obtain the right for the Licensee to continue to use the products/the update as agreed in the 
provisions of this agreement, or 
(b) replace the products/the update with another product that allows the contractual use in a 
comparable manner, provided that, upon weighing up the interests of both parties, it transpires that 
such a replacement is reasonable for the Licensee, or 
(c) modify the products/the update in such a manner that a defect in title no longer exists or the risk of 
such a defect in title occurring no longer exists, whereas, however, the products/the update nevertheless meet the requirements of a contractual use, or
(d) withdraw from and reverse the agreement.

The Licensee shall to a reasonable extent assist LANCOM with the defense of any claims by the third 
party. The Licensee shall in particular 
(a) immediately inform LANCOM in writing when a third party has approached the Licensee claiming 
that the contractual use of the products/updates provided by LANCOM violates their rights,
(b) shall disclose no details to the third party that are likely to worsen the position of LANCOM and 
(c) authorize LANCOM to take sole control over the dispute with the third party, both in terms of 
judicial and extrajudicial settlement.

The Licensee's claims from liability for defects in title shall expire one (1) year after delivery of the 
product. This shall not apply if LANCOM has concealed the defect in title fraudulently, or if LANCOM 
has provided a warranty in regard to the quality.


10) Liability for defects in quality

LANCOM shall be liable for any defects in the quality of the software in accordance with the following 
provisions.

Limitation of the liability for defects in quality:
The Licensee acknowledges that, as per the technical state of the art, it is not possible to develop data 
processing programs which are in particular linked with other programs or equipment in such a way 
that they function in an entirely error-free manner. In line with the state of the art, operation that is free 
of interruptions and errors, as well as the complete fixing of any software bugs, cannot be entirely 
guaranteed. Individual requirements of the Licensee shall only be deemed a component of the 
contractually agreed quality of the software if they have explicitly been defined in writing in advance in 
a specification of services that has been formulated jointly.
Product descriptions shall, without a separate written agreement, not be deemed a warranty, and shall 
also not constitute a warranty concerning properties.
In the case of updates, upgrades or new versions provided, the liability for defects in quality shall be 
limited to the innovations included in the update, upgrade or new version provided in comparison to 
the previous version status.

Exclusion of liability for defects in quality:
LANCOM does not provide any warranty for the products fulfilling the special requirements of the 
Licensee or being executable in the system environment envisaged by the Licensee. The latter shall 
not apply if LANCOM has undertaken adaptation to the software at the customer’s request, has given 
an explicit warranty, or the system environment envisaged corresponds to the requirements of the 
documentation.

LANCOM shall not be held liable if the claims which the third party asserts are based on one of the 
following circumstances:
a) the products/updates being linked to equipment, devices, firmware or computer programs of other 
manufacturers, which have not been supplied by LANOM in its own name on its own account, and 
where LANCOM has neither permitted the linking nor violated any existing obligation to point out that 
such linking is to be refrained from;
(b) any modification to the products/updates made by the Licensee or a third party commissioned by it;
(c) the agreed use of the products/update being exceeded;
(d) the Licensee having failed to install any modifications, patches or updates provided by LANCOM; 
or
(e) the implementation of specifications, technical concepts or instructions of the Licensee by 
LANCOM.

Should it transpire that the problems which have occurred have not been caused by the software 
provided for use by LANCOM, but by software products of third parties or by the hardware used, any 
claims for defects asserted against LANCOM by the Licensee in this respect shall be excluded. The 
same shall apply if the Licensee uses the software contrary to contract, or if the Licensee or a third 
party commissioned by it has modified or revised the software, or merely insignificant deviations from 
the contractually agreed quality of the software are concerned.


11) Limitation of liability in general and in the event of data loss

Except in cases of mandatory statutory liability (in particular under the German Product Liability Act), 
as well as when providing a warranty, in the case of losses caused due to willful intent or gross 
negligence or bodily harm caused culpably, LANCOM’s statutory and/or contractual liability for 
compensation for damage shall be limited as follows:

LANCOM shall be liable up to the amount of the damage that is typically foreseeable at the time of 
concluding the agreement for slightly negligent infringement of any essential obligations arising from 
the contractual relationship (i.e. any obligations, the fulfillment of which makes it possible to duly 
execute the agreement in the first place, the infringement of which puts the achievement of the 
contractual purpose at risk, and adherence to which the Licensee usually relies on, viz. cardinal 
obligations);
LANCOM shall not be liable for the slightly negligent infringement of any non-essential obligations 
arising from the contractual relationship. 
LANCOM shall not be liable for indirect and/or consequential damage, regardless of on what legal 
grounds, in particular not for lost profits or losses of interest.
LANCOM shall not be liable for restoring data. To the extent that this limitation of liability is not 
applicable, the liability for data loss shall be limited to the typical restoration effort which would have 
occurred had back-ups been made regularly and in line with the risk.
To the extent that LANCOM’s liability in accordance with the clauses above is excluded or limited, the 
latter shall also apply to personal liability on the part of LANCOM’s representatives, employees and 
vicarious agents.


12) Miscellaneous provisions

This agreement is subject to German law. Local jurisdiction for any disputes arising from or in 
connection with this agreement shall be Aachen. LANCOM shall, however, be entitled to sue the 
Licensee at any other statutory place of jurisdiction.
Any amendments or additions to these licensing conditions shall require to be made in writing in order 
to be legally valid.
Any deviating General Terms and Conditions of Business, including any which, are, for example, 
included with an order or delivery confirmation of the Licensee, shall not apply unless the parties have 
agreed anything to the contrary in writing.
The end user agrees to the latter.


13) Severability clause

Should a provision of this agreement be or become invalid or unenforceable, or should these licensing 
conditions contain a loophole, the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be 
affected thereby. LANCOM and the Licensee undertake to replace any invalid provision with a valid 
provision that comes as close as possible to said invalid provision.

=============================================================

In all other respects, the General Terms and Conditions of Business of LANCOM shall apply.

[4] BSD License Change
----------------------

July 22, 1999

To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:

As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source
code files require that further distributions of products containing all or
portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials
that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its
contributors.

Specifically, the provision reads:

"     * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
      *    must display the following acknowledgement:
      *    This product includes software developed by the University of
      *    California, Berkeley and its contributors."

Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to
include the acknowledgement within advertising materials.  Accordingly, the
foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
in its entirety.
